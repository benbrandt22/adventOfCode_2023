# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my entries for the Advent of Code 2023 daily coding challenge at https://adventofcode.com/2023

All details about the goal for each day can be found on the website. The contents of this solution is just the input data and my code for generating the solutions.

Puzzle solutions are handled as unit tests. The daily puzzle is set up as a test class, and individual parts of the 
puzzle are set up as XUnit unit tests. This allows the sample test cases to be checked 
against their known solutions, and also allows for easy execution of any puzzle through the unit test explorer. Test 
puzzle output is written to the unit test output.
